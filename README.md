# Multimodal Live API - Web console

This repository contains a react-based starter app for using the [Multimodal Live API](https://ai.google.dev/api/multimodal-live) over a websocket. It provides modules for streaming audio playback, recording user media such as from a microphone, webcam or screen capture as well as a unified log view to aid in development of your application.

Watch the demo of the Multimodal Live API [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_q7JY1XxFE).

## Usage

To get started, [create a free Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and add it to the `.env` file. Then:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Live Reload Version

Since this is a modified version of the [Multimodal Live API Console](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console), you will need to run the server proxy and the frontend separately.

In 2 separate terminals, run the following commands:

```
$ npm run start
```

```
$ npm run start-server
```

The app should run on `http://localhost:3000`

## Note

This is a modified version of the [Multimodal Live API Console](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console) that uses a server proxy to keep your Gemini API key secure in deployment. The original repository is meant to run entirely as a frontend client.


## Example

Below is an example of an entire application that will use Google Search grounding and then render graphs using [vega-embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed):

```typescript
import { type FunctionDeclaration, SchemaType } from "@google/generative-ai";
import { useEffect, useRef, useState, memo } from "react";
import vegaEmbed from "vega-embed";
import { useLiveAPIContext } from "../../contexts/LiveAPIContext";

export const declaration: FunctionDeclaration = {
  name: "render_altair",
  description: "Displays an altair graph in json format.",
  parameters: {
    type: SchemaType.OBJECT,
    properties: {
      json_graph: {
        type: SchemaType.STRING,
        description:
          "JSON STRING representation of the graph to render. Must be a string, not a json object",
      },
    },
    required: ["json_graph"],
  },
};

export function Altair() {
  const [jsonString, setJSONString] = useState<string>("");
  const { client, setConfig } = useLiveAPIContext();

  useEffect(() => {
    setConfig({
      model: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
      systemInstruction: {
        parts: [
          {
            text: 'You are my helpful assistant. Any time I ask you for a graph call the "render_altair" function I have provided you. Dont ask for additional information just make your best judgement.',
          },
        ],
      },
      tools: [{ googleSearch: {} }, { functionDeclarations: [declaration] }],
    });
  }, [setConfig]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const onToolCall = (toolCall: ToolCall) => {
      console.log(`got toolcall`, toolCall);
      const fc = toolCall.functionCalls.find(
        (fc) => fc.name === declaration.name
      );
      if (fc) {
        const str = (fc.args as any).json_graph;
        setJSONString(str);
      }
    };
    client.on("toolcall", onToolCall);
    return () => {
      client.off("toolcall", onToolCall);
    };
  }, [client]);

  const embedRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (embedRef.current && jsonString) {
      vegaEmbed(embedRef.current, JSON.parse(jsonString));
    }
  }, [embedRef, jsonString]);
  return <div className="vega-embed" ref={embedRef} />;
}
```

## development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Project consists of:

- an Event-emitting websocket-client to ease communication between the websocket and the front-end
- communication layer for processing audio in and out
- a boilerplate view for starting to build your apps and view logs

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
